# BloodCellDetector_Yolov5
This project uses Deep convolutional neural nets to perform object detection on Blood Cell Images and Calculate - RBC , WBC , Platelets - on large image set to check density of Blood Cells which helps in predicting diseases related to Blood cells.

We have BloodCellWeights.pt
