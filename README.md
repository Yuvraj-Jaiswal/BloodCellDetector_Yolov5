# BloodCellDetector_Yolov5
This project uses Deep convolutional neural nets to perform object detection on Blood Cell Images and Calculate - RBC , WBC , Platelets - on large image set to check density of Blood Cells which helps in predicting diseases related to Blood cells.

We have BloodCell-Weights.pt which i had trained 200 epoch at 32 bach size.

In order to Run this project first install all required pakages from Requirements.txt

Then Run BloodCell_Detector.py ... which takes images from Data folder and count all RBC,WBC and Platelets with visual results through OpenCV
